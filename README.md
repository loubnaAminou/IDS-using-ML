# IDS using ML

### ARCHITECTURE
This project was a component of an FL architecture designed for detecting intrusions in an industrial IoT (I-IoT) environment. It employed the concept of federated learning, where the trained model resides on a global server shared among end devices. These devices gather data related to potential attacks, analyze it using the model, and subsequently transmit updated parameters back to the server.

### DATASET

I worked with a dataset called "KDD'99 - KDD Cup 1999 Data," which was specifically put together to provide the information needed to determine whether network activities are malicious or benign.. In this case, we used it for supervised learning, where we classify network events into different categories. There are five such categories, each representing a group of similar attacks.
